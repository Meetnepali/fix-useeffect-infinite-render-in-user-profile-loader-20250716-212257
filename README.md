# Task Overview
You are presented with a React application whose PreferencesPanel manages a dark/light theme and language switching. Following a recent refactor, the theme selection does not reliably persist across page reloads, and toggling the theme sometimes updates only part of the interface. There are also React warnings related to useEffect dependencies. Your task is to debug the issue and refactor state management, effect logic, and synchronization to ensure theme persistence and consistent app-wide updates.

# Guidance
Consider the flow of state and effects responsible for applying and persisting user preferences. Investigate potential issues around synchronization between localStorage, React state, and the theme context. Properly organize dependencies and initialization logic to eliminate React warnings and avoid render loops or missed updates. Focus on achieving a unified, professional user preference experience throughout the application.

# Objectives
Restore reliable persistence of the selected theme across reloads. Ensure that theme changes update the appearance of all components instantly. Resolve any React warnings arising from useEffect dependencies. Your finished solution should provide a seamless and professional user experience with synchronized preferences.

# How to Verify
After applying your changes, verify that changing the theme updates the entire application's style without needing a reload, and that the chosen theme remains active after reloading the page. Check that React warnings related to useEffect dependencies are resolved and no longer appear. All components should consistently reflect the selected preferences.
